# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file

# This file is used to configure Snyk's behavior for the Dex MCP Server project.
# It defines vulnerability exceptions, patch strategies, and security policies.

# IMPORTANT: This project handles PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
# All security vulnerabilities should be taken seriously and patched promptly.

# To use Snyk:
# 1. Create a free account at https://snyk.io
# 2. Run `npx snyk auth` to authenticate
# 3. Run `npm run security` to scan for vulnerabilities
# 4. For CI/CD, set SNYK_TOKEN secret in GitHub repository settings

# Specifies for which language Snyk is used (npm for Node.js projects)
language-settings:
  javascript:
    # Fail build on medium severity or higher
    # Given that this app handles PII, we use strict thresholds
    severity-threshold: medium
    # Ignore dev dependencies for production deployments
    # (uncomment if you want to skip devDependencies)
    # ignore-dev-dependencies: true

# Exclude certain paths from security scanning (they don't affect runtime)
exclude:
  # Development and build artifacts
  - dist/
  - dist-test/
  - coverage/
  - node_modules/

  # Test files (not deployed to production)
  - test/
  - '**/*.test.ts'
  - '**/*.spec.ts'

  # Configuration and documentation
  - '*.md'
  - '*.json'

# Vulnerability exceptions and ignores
# Format:
#   - '<vulnerability-id>':
#       - '*':
#           reason: 'Explanation of why this is acceptable'
#           expires: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
ignore: {}

# Patches to apply (Snyk can auto-patch some vulnerabilities)
patch: {}

# Version of this policy file
